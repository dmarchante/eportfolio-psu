                    The context of marriage in the United States involves
                    not only whether and when Americans choose to marry,
                    but also how many times they marry. The majority of
                    recent marriages are first marriages for both spouses. However, divorce rates are higher in the United States
                    compared with European nations,1 and remarried adults
                    have a higher likelihood of divorce than those in their
                    first marriage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2008, a series of marital history questions were added to the American Community Survey (ACS). These items, shown in Figure 1, construct a history of marriage, divorce, and widowhood among respondents by recording: (1) whether adults had married, been widowed, or divorced in the past year; (2) how many times adults had married; and (3) the year adults most recently married. One of the strengths of ACS data is that estimates are available for sub-state geographic areas. Further, the ACS provides marital history data on adults of all ages whether they reside in households or group quarters. This report provides information on the following topics: (1) basic marital history measures by sex and age, (2) characteristics of adults by how many times they had married, (3) marital history information by sex and birth cohort, (4) the proportion of couples that include spouses who had married more than once, and (5) geographic variation in the percentage of adults who had married two or more times. In particular, it provides a look at both states and metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with relatively high or low proportions of men or women who had married atleast twice. This report, which uses 5-year data from the 2008–2012 ACS, presents the first detailed profile of this group provided with this level of geographic detail. Previously, marital history data were collected only in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and smaller ACS samples, which are too small to provide estimates at the MSA level.

                        About half of all men (50 percent) and women (54      percent)aged 15 and over had married only once.

                        The proportion of adults that had married only once has decreased since 1996, from 54 percent to 50 percent of men and 60 percent to 54 percent of women.

                    <li>
                        Between 1996 and 2008-2012, the share of those that had married twice or three or more times increased only for women aged 50 and older and men aged 60 and older.

                        Non-Hispanic White men and women are most likely to have married three or more times, while Asian men and women are least likely.

                    <li>
                        Those with at least a bachelor’s degree are more likely to have married only once (64 percent) than all adults (52 percent).

                        The majority of recent marriages (58 percent) are first marriages for both spouses, although 21 percent involve both spousesmarrying for at least the second time.

                        States with a lower share of evermarried adults who had remarried are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, while Southern and Western states generally have a higher share.

                    How Many Men and Women Had Married More Than Once
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Table 1 provides a look at some basic measures of marital history by age and sex. A majority of adults aged 15 and over had ever married: two-thirds of men and 72 percent of women. Marital history does differ somewhat by sex, as women tend to marry earlier than men. For example, about 18 percent of women aged 20 to 24 had ever married, compared with  11 percent of men. Marital history is also shown for various age groups since it varies throughout the life course. For example, we would not expect many teens to be married. Indeed, when looking at older age groups, who have  had more time to marry, we see that more had done so. For all age groups of women aged 30 and over, the majority had married, as had the majority of men aged 30 and over. Thus, despite concerns of a “retreat from marriage,”5 this life event continues to be pursued and achieved by most in America. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although most Americans marry, they do not necessarily remain in a particular marriage for life. In addition to reviewing whether men and women ever marry, information on the number of times they marry and whether they are still in a particular marriage is important. About half of all adults aged 15 and over had married once: 50 percent of men and 54 percent of women (Table 1). There were 40 percent of men and 37 percent of women still in their first marriage, 13 percent of men and 14 percent of women had married twice, and 4 percent had married three or more times.6 Age is an important factor relating to remarriage, as older individuals have had more time to see a previous marriage conclude and to remarry. The proportion of men and women married twice is about 20 percent or higher for men and women aged 50 to 69.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comparing the data in Table 1 to previous reports sheds light on patterns of marital history over time. Previous census reports describe data from the 1996, 2001, and 2009 SIPP.7 Here, we compare 2008–2012 ACS data against 1996 SIPP data to look at changes in marital history over a substantial length of time. Between 1996 and 2008–2012, the proportion of adults who had never married increased, from 31 percent to 34 percent for men and from 24 percent to 28 percent for women.
